Thanks for your interest! There is still significant work to be done on the
core before accepting contributions generally, but there are a number of
small TODOs throughout for which I would welcome some help. Currently
these are:

* ?weakenNs_rhs in Core.TT
    - plus other support functions for TT to be ported from existing Idris 2
* Tidy up Show instance for 'Term'
* Pretty printing of Term and TTImp
