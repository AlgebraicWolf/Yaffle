Conventions
-----------

* No `mutual`, always forward declare
  + Related: no declaring in one module and defining in another
* Indent so that alpha conversion always works with a simple search and
  replace. In general this would mean starting a new line when starting a
  new level of indentation.
* Use `parameters` blocks for avoiding boilerplate when passing state around.
